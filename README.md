2018 Computational Journalism Class: Tech, Media and Democracy
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this year's edition of the course, we will be focusing on computational tools and techniques that, while not necessarily new, certainly achieved new prominence in the national election in 2018 and beyond. The vast networks of information that are created every day are simply too large for us to examine in their entirety. To get a sense of "what's on," we take feeds from algorithmic recommender systems, we scan trending topics, we focus on information shared with us by our friends or people we trust. Recently, we have seen how these tools and strategies for directing our attention can be hacked. Our course is part of a city-wide effort to create new technologies, to look for new kinds of stories, that respond to this new societal condition, to these "threats to journalism." The broad initiative is described [here](https://www.techmediademocracy.nyc/) and you'll see that there are six campuses involved -- Cornell Tech, Columbia University, City University of New York, New York University, The New School and The Pratt Institute.

From the all-city class syllabus:

>This course will bring together journalism, design, media studies, and technical disciplines to understand the various threats to journalism and media, and attempt to address these challenges using technical and computational methods and techniques. The free press, journalism and the media are some of the most critical elements of our democracy, but have been increasingly under attack by political and market forces. These challenges include: dwindling resources and support for deep investigative journalism; smear, law and technical and even physical assaults of media organizations and journalists; challenges to credibility and reliability including fake news and discrediting campaigns; and shifting business models and income sources that threaten both local and national news organizations and coverage.

This repository will hold our in-class notebooks (our in-class computational lessons), your homework and readings and various data sets. 

Fun!
