    "Before we take take a look at APIs, let's take a step back and learn about how the web works. Understanding some of the fundamentals about how information travels around the internet will help us a ton. And, the best place to start is by learning about HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple protocol called [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) powers most of the communications on the web, including your browser and probably most of the apps that you use. HTTP allows you (via your browser, a mobile app or even code you write!) to **request** data (HTML, PDFs, MP3s, etc) from a service across the internet (e.g. google.com, twitter.com) and that service will respond with the requested data (i.e. the **response**).\n",

    "1. a \"**client**\" (your browser, your Instagram app, or even some code that you are about to write) makes a **request** for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the **request** is in the form of a [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL). The URL specifies the site and page/document/data. For example: https://nytimes.com/ or https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/technology/personaltech/huawei-mate-10-pro-smartphone-review.html\n",
    "\n",
