    "Today we are going to roll up our sleeves and get dirty with Alexa. You've had some experience mapping out your conversation and today we are going to turn these descriptions into actions that Alexa can take. Alexa's reactions will be modeled, ultimately, by *functions* in Python. We will be using a framework called Flask-Ask (a variant of an earlier framework for building your own API called Flask -- which we will get to eventually). Ah, but before we get too far, let's talk about how you make functions!\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we have made a lot of use of the cell structure of your notebooks. We've tried to organize things so that each cell or maybe each \"chapter\" of a notebook accomplishes some task. And we have been encouraging you to make changes to the parameters (chaging file names, or picking different numbers) and reuse the code. In short the notebook has let you repeat analysis by creating chunks of text that you can use again on different data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a little clunky. It's great when you are learning, but it's not the way Python developers think. The main technique to share code is via Python's package mechanism. We have seen packages like Tweepy and Pandas and TextBlob. The creators of each have provided us with new kinds of objects to accomplish new tasks, from making requests for data on the web to working with tabular data. These objects extend Python's basic functionality and is probably the key to its longevity and broad adoption. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages consist of simple data, objects and a category of thing we have used but not named -- *functions.* When we use `read_csv()` we are invoking a function that takes as *input* a file name or URL and *returns as output* a DataFrame. When we use `search()` from the package `re`, we are calling a function that takes as *input* a string and a pattern (in the form of a regular expression) and *returns* a match object, telling us whether the pattern was found or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are basically blocks of code that we will want to use repeatedly. Remember, Python structures blocks of code using indentation. Below is a simple function -- it basically adds 2 to whatever you pass it. *Baby steps!*"

In this example, Leo would be the custom slot. \n",
