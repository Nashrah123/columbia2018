    "Last week you learned the basics of web scraping: fetching HTML documents and parsing information within the documents using BeautifulSoup. In the examples from last week, we learned how to scrape \"viewable\" information from the HTML. By \"viewable\" information, I mean information that you as a user can see on the page. Today, we're going to learn about `metadata`: the rich set of information found in Web pages that are for machines. And, by \"machines\", I mean crawlers (for search engines, facebook, twitter, etc), browers and even your very own python code.\n",

Simply put, _Microformats are a way to use html pages as both a human readable document and machine readable data, without repetition._\n",

[Microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) are still used and supported but as we'll see, new metadata formats came along...\n",

    "hResume - individual resumes and CVs\n",
    "hReview - individual reviews and ratings\n",

    "Now that you are masters of web scraping, it's time to combine your scraping skills with your bot making skills! For Monday, we'd like you to build a simple bot that tweets out fact-checking claims from one of (or more!) of the fact-checking sites. You can use one of the sites we mentioned above, like the [Washington Post Fact Checker blog](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/), or find another. Use your bot that we created back in [notebook 06 \"Bottland\"](https://github.com/computationaljournalism/columbia2018/blob/master/notebooks/06_Botland_1.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",

    "**Some Hints:**\n",
    "* pick a [fact-checking site](https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking/) of your choice (can do more than one)\n",
    "* look for the site's RSS feed and use our friend [`feedparser`](https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/) (again, from notebook 06) to find all of the fact-checking articles that the site publishes\n",
    "* once you have a fact-checking article URL, you can BeautifulSoup to parse & find the `ClaimReview`\n",
    "* format the information from the `ClaimReview` and have your bot tweet it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Points:**\n",
    "* can you find any sources that the fact-check is disputing? this is interesting information for your bot to include\n",
    "* have your bot run 24x7\n",
    "* make sure the bot doesn't tweet out the same thing more than once\n"
