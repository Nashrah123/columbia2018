    "### Microformats\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 2005, a group of people came up with the notion of a \"Microformat.\" The idea was to use additional markup in HTML to allow machines to easily discover data inside HTML (like our calendar event or news story). Simply put, _Microformats are a way to use html pages as both a human readable document and machine readable data, without repetition._\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was originally a grassroots movement from developers but it was soon supported by some search engines and browers. It was never part of a standards body though - just an \"informal\" specification. [Microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) are still used and supported but as we'll see, new metadata formats came along...\n",
    "\n",
    "Microformats allowed developers to highlight specific elements/types of content within a page, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hAtom - blog posts and other date-stamped content\n",
    "hCalendar - events\n",
    "hCard - people, organizations, contacts\n",
    "hListing - listings for products or services\n",
    "hMedia - media info about images, video, audio\n",
    "hProduct - products\n",
    "hRecipe - cooking+baking recipes\n",
    "hResume - individual resumes and CVs\n",
    "hReview - individual reviews and ratings\n",
    "hReview-aggregate - aggregate reviews and ratings\n",
    "adr - address location information\n",
    "geo - latitude & longitude location (WGS84 geographic coordinates)\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. Search engines now have help in knowing what a page, or data within a page, is about.\n",
    "2. Search engines can use this markup to know what to show in something like a \"rich snippet.\"\n",

These were created and driven by various standard bodies, commercial interests (publishers, social networks, search engines, browsers) and developers.
