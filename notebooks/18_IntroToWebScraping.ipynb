    "We've been collecting data in class using various APIs and (downloadable) CSV files. While APIs can provide an easy way to get to information we need for our analysys and reporting, there are plenty other valuable data sources for us to take advantage: web pages (HTML), pdf files, email dumps, etc. Automating the extraction of useful information from web pages is known as **\"web scraping.\"** A terrible name aside, web scraping is very powerful and it's something you'll want to master. Today, we'll talk about some of the basics of web scraping.\n",

    "### Microformats\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 2005, a group of people came up with the notion of a \"Microformat.\" The idea was to use additional markup in HTML to allow machines to easily discover data inside HTML (like our calendar event or news story). Simply put, _Microformats are a way to use html pages as both a human readable document and machine readable data, without repetition._\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was originally a grassroots movement from developers but it was soon supported by some search engines and browers. It was never part of a standards body though - just an \"informal\" specification. [Microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) are still used and supported but as we'll see, new metadata formats came along...\n",
    "\n",
    "Microformats allowed developers to highlight specific elements/types of content within a page, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hAtom - blog posts and other date-stamped content\n",
    "hCalendar - events\n",
    "hCard - people, organizations, contacts\n",
    "hListing - listings for products or services\n",
    "hMedia - media info about images, video, audio\n",
    "hProduct - products\n",
    "hRecipe - cooking+baking recipes\n",
    "hResume - individual resumes and CVs\n",
    "hReview - individual reviews and ratings\n",
    "hReview-aggregate - aggregate reviews and ratings\n",
    "adr - address location information\n",
    "geo - latitude & longitude location (WGS84 geographic coordinates)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What good does this do? What can we do with Micoformats?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things:\n",
    "1. Search engines now have help in knowing what a page, or data within a page, is about.\n",
    "2. Search engines can use this markup to know what to show in something like a \"rich snippet.\"\n",
    "3. Browsers started adding the ability to do things like detect an event in a page and allow a user to add it to their calendar (or a person's information to their Address book).\n",

These were created and driven by various standard bodies, commercial interests (publishers, social networks, search engines, browsers) and developers. Again, the goal of these were to make it easier for machines to make sense of the data published inside web pages and to use that data to help display, rank and make publisher's content easier to interact with.\n",

    "Similar to Microformats, Microdata is defined as: _This specification defines the HTML microdata mechanism. This mechanism allows machine-readable data to be embedded in HTML documents in an easy-to-write manner, with an unambiguous parsing model. It is compatible with numerous other data formats including RDF and JSON._\n",
    "\n",
    "Though `Microdata` is not an official spec of *The W3C* (_The W3C HTML Working Group failed to find an editor for the specification and terminated its development with a 'Note'._) it is supported by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex. In fact, these companies came together to create a vocabulary (specification, essentially) around microdata that is published at http://schema.org/. These companies have tried to establish and open forum and community-based process for updating the vocabulary/specification.\n",
